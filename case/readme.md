## Peacock Trackpad Case by bomtarnes ([keyboard-magpie](https://github.com/keyboard-magpie/))

Included are STL and STEP files, intended for FDM 3D printing.

Also included are DXF and SVG files intended as a template for making a trackpad overlay (e.g. from Self adhesive vinyl).

The case is designed for m3 hardware in the corners- I used m3x6mm. There is 1 spot for an m2x6mm screw in the centre of the macropad.

Optionally, you can use longer m3 bolts to tilt the back of the case up for comfort.
